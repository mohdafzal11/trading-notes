# Market Structure in Trading and Financial Markets

Market structure refers to the way a market is organized — including how prices move, how traders participate, and what phases the market goes through.

Here are the main types of market structure commonly used in trading:

## 1. Trending Market
- Prices consistently move up (uptrend) or down (downtrend)
- Higher highs & higher lows = uptrend
- Lower highs & lower lows = downtrend
- Traders usually follow the trend: “Trend is your friend”

## 2. Ranging or Sideways Market
- Prices move between support and resistance
- No clear up or down direction
- Good for trading breakouts or reversals at range boundaries

## 3. Consolidation
- A tight range where price pauses after a strong move
- Indicates market indecision
- Often appears before big breakouts

## 4. Distribution
- Typically occurs after an uptrend
- Smart money (big players) are selling
- Can signal a trend reversal downward

## 5. Accumulation
- Typically occurs after a downtrend
- Smart money is buying quietly
- Signals a potential trend reversal upward

## 6. Breakout / Expansion Phase
- Price escapes a range or consolidation area
- Increased volume + volatility
- Often start of a new trend

## 7. Reversal Structure
- Price changes direction
- Patterns like:
  - Double top / bottom
  - Head & shoulders
  - Change of character (CHoCH)
  - Market Structure Shift (MSS)
