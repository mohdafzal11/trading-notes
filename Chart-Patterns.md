# Candlestick Patterns: Tiny Soap-Opera Stars of Bulls vs. Bears

Candles come in many dramatic personalities, each one a tiny soap-opera star portraying the struggle between bulls and bears. Here are the most popular types of candlesticks traders pay attention to:

## Doji
A candle of indecision. Buyers and sellers fight to a draw. It looks like a little plus sign.  
**Interpretation:** Market is unsure, a reversal may be brewing.

## Hammer
Tiny body, long lower wick. Imagine price plunging then being heroically saved.  
**Bullish** when found at a bottom.

## Shooting Star
The hammer’s evil twin. Small body, long upper wick.  
**Bearish** when found at a top.

## Spinning Top
Small body with long wicks on both sides.  
Indecision but a bit more chaotic than a doji.

## Marubozu
A candle with no wicks. Pure conviction.  
- **Green Marubozu:** Bulls dominate.  
- **Red Marubozu:** Bears rule the world.

## Engulfing Candles
A big candle eats the previous one like Pac-Man.  
- **Bullish engulfing** at bottom = buyers take control.  
- **Bearish engulfing** at top = sellers take over.

## Morning Star
A hopeful 3-candle formation that whispers “trend reversal.”  
Seen at the bottom, signaling bullish actions ahead.

## Evening Star
The Morning Star’s opposite. Appears at the top, signaling bearish moves approaching.

## Harami
A tiny candle inside a big candle like a baby kangaroo in a pouch.  
Potential slowing of trend.

## Three Soldiers / Three Crows
- **Three green candles marching up** = bullish strength  
- **Three red candles spiraling downward** = bearish dominance

## Pin Bar
Very small body with a long nose (wick).  
Lies told by price get exposed soon after.
